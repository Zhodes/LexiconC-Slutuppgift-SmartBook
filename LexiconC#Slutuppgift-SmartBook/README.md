SmartBook is a console-based application for managing a library of books.
Users can:
Add new books
Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
Update availability (check in/out)
Remove Books
Save and load the library to/from a file

The main menu of the application:
1. Add Book
2. List All Books
3. Search
4. Save Library To File
5. Load Library From File
0. Exit the application

there are two type of menus in the application, numbered menus and searchable menus. 
Numbered menus are used when there is a set number of options that can't be changed by the user. For example the main menu.
Numbered menus are used by pressing the key that corresponds to your selection. you can exit a numbered menu by pressing 0.

Searchable menus are used when the lists size can be changed by the user. To navigate searchable menus you can both write a searchword and the menu updates by each keystroke.
You can also use the arrow keys upp and down to change what your selection is. Your selection is noted by a ">" symbol on the lefthand side of the screen. 
If you move the ">" to outside the size of a searchable list it wraps around. 
Pressing esc exits the menu

1. The Add Book function first prompts you to add its title, then choose from a searchable list of authors or you can choose to ad new author. After adding an author you choose from a searchable list of categorys with the option to add new category. 
After that you add its ISBN, you must use a number of exactly 10 or 13 digits that is not in use by any other book. 

Currently you cant add authors or categorys outside of the add book feature, but would an author be an author if they had no books?

2. List all books lists all books by title, press any key to exit

3. To update availability of books or remove books you enter the search menu, make a selection on what field you whould like to search on and when you have found the book you are looking for you move the ">" character to it and press enter. 
From there you will enter a menu with options to update availability and remove book.
In the update availability section changes availability only requires pressing y or n. In the remove book option it requires you to write "Yes" or "No". This also applies to the , save to file and load from file feature. 
These features are deemed to need higher levels of security and therefore a simple key press is not sufficient as a user input.

4. saves to file, will prompt the user to decide with "Yes" or "No"

5. loads from file, will prompt the user to decide with "Yes" or "No"

0. exits the application

All functionality is deemed to be sufficiently tested. Please report if there are any buggs that are unknown to us.
